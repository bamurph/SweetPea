     For example, you might want to block a specific episode if you know that its content would otherwise cause the entire podcast to be removed from the iTunes Store. Specifying any value other than Yes has no effect.

     Users can browse podcast subject categories in the iTunes Store by choosing a category from the Podcasts pop-up menu in the navigation bar. Use the <itunes:category> tag to specify the browsing category for your podcast.

     You can also define a subcategory if one is available within your category. Although you can specify more than one category and subcategory in your feed, the iTunes Store only recognizes the first category and subcategory. For a complete list of categories and subcategories, see Podcasts Connect categories.

     Note: When specifying categories and subcategories, be sure to properly escape ampersands:

     Single category:

     <itunes:category text="Music" />
     Category with ampersand:

     <itunes:category text="TV &amp; Film" />
     Category with subcategory:

     <itunes:category text="Society &amp; Culture">
     <itunes:category text="History" />

     Specify your podcast artwork using the <a href> attribute in the<itunes:image> tag. If you do not specify the <itunes:image> tag, the iTunes Store uses the content specified in the RSS feed image tag and Apple does not consider your podcast for feature placement on the iTunes Store or Podcasts.

     Depending on their device, subscribers see your podcast artwork in varying sizes. Therefore, make sure your design is effective at both its original size and at thumbnail size. Apple recommends including a title, brand, or source name as part of your podcast artwork. For examples of podcast artwork, see the Top Podcasts. To avoid technical issues when you update your podcast artwork, be sure to:

     Change the artwork file name and URL at the same time
     Verify the web server hosting your artwork allows HTTP head requests
     The <itunes:image> tag is also supported at the <item> (episode) level. For best results, Apple recommends embedding the same artwork within the metadata for that episodeâ€™s media file prior to uploading to your host server; using Garageband or another content-creation tool to edit your media file if needed.

     Note: Artwork must be a minimum size of 1400 x 1400 pixels and a maximum size of 3000 x 3000 pixels, in JPEG or PNG format, 72 dpi, with appropriate file extensions (.jpg, .png), and in the RGB colorspace. These requirements are different from the standard RSS image tag specifications.

     Clean | No | False. If you specify clean, no, or false, indicating that none of your podcast episodes contain explicit language or adult content, the iTunes Store displays a Clean parental advisory graphic for your podcast.
